# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Overview

This repository contains five machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each project addresses a real-world problem using data-driven solutions. Below is a brief description of each:

---

## 📌 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection (`creditcardfraud.ipynb`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data.

**Solution:**  
Implemented a classification model using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The dataset was imbalanced, so techniques like SMOTE and undersampling were used to improve accuracy on the minority (fraudulent) class.

## 📌 2. Insurance Cost Prediction (`Insurancecost.ipynb`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Predict the medical insurance charges based on user demographics and health conditions.

**Solution:**  
Applied regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) to model the relationship between features like age, BMI, smoking habits, and insurance charges. Achieved a good R² score through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📌 3. Customer Segmentation (`CustomerSegementation.ipynb`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Classify customers into different categories based on their characteristics to improve targeted marketing.

**Solution:**  
Used Logistic Regression to identify and classify customer segments based on features like income and spending score. The model helps in understanding customer behavior and tailoring services accordingly.

## 📌 4. Spam Mail Classification (`Spam_mail.ipynb`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Classify emails as spam or not spam.

**Solution:**  
Built a text classification model using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classifier. Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam emails.

## 📌 5. Breast Cancer Prediction (`Breast_Cancer.ipynb`)

**Problem Statement:**  
Predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical attributes.

**Solution:**  
Used classification models like Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Achieved high accuracy and recall, crucial for medical diagnosis.
